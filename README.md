## Access Controls

#### Creating New User
```sql
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```
the hostname part is set to `localhost`, so the user will be able to connect to the MySQL server only from the localhost.  
To grant access from another host, change the hostname part with the remote machine IP.  
```sql
CREATE USER 'username'@'172.8.10.5' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password';
```
To create a user that can connect from any host, '%' is used in the hostname part:
```sql
CREATE USER 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password';
```

#### Grant All Permissions
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'username'@'localhost';
```
Asterisks(\*) refers to the database and table names respectively.  
By using asterisks we can give access of all the databases **or** tables to the user. 

#### Flush Privileges
```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES
```
All the changes won't be in effect unless this query is fired.

#### Specific User Permissions
```sql
GRANT type_of_permission ON database_name.table_name TO 'username'@'localhost';
```
`type_of_permission` may have one of these value: 
* **ALL PRIVILEGES** - Allows user full access to a designated database (or if no database is selected, global access across the system).
* **CREATE** - allows them to create new tables or databases.
* **DROP** - allows them to them to delete tables or databases.
* **DELETE** - allows them to delete rows from tables.
* **INSERT** - allows them to insert rows into tables.
* **SELECT** - allows them to use the `SELECT` command to read through databases.
* **UPDATE** - allow them to update table rows.
* **GRANT OPTION** - allows them to grant or remove other usersâ€™ privileges.  
Multiple permissions are given with commas.

#### Revoking permissions
```sql
REVOKE type_of_permission ON database_name.table_name FROM 'username'@'localhost';
```

#### Show User's Current Permissions
```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'localhost';
```

#### Delete a User
```sql
DROP USER 'username'@'localhost';
```

#### Set new password to a user
```sql
use mysql;
update user set authentication_string=PASSWORD("<new2-password>") where User='<user>';
flush privileges;
```

## Reset Root Password
Stop MySQL service 
```
sudo systemctl stop mysql
```
Restart MySQL service without loading grant tables
```bash
sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
```
The apersand (&) will cause the program to run in the background and `--skip-grant-tables` enables everyone to to connect to the database server without a password and with all privileges granted.
Login to shell
```
mysql -u root
```
Set new password for root
```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MY_NEW_PASSWORD';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
Stop and start the server once again
```
mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
sudo systemctl start mysql
```
